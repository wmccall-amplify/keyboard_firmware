QMK Firmware for the Centromere keyboard. Centromere is a custom wireless ergonomic keyboard, with 6x3 columnar staggered keys and a 3 key thumb cluster. Centromere keyboards can utilize hot-swap Kailh sockets for MX switches, and either Choc or MX switches can be permanently soldered. There are two types of receiver that use two different MCU for the Centromere board, and you can define which one you are using by defining your rules.mk file appropriately, as shown in the default keymaps.
