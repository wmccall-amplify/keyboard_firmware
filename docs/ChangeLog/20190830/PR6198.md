* Backport changes to keymap language files from ZSA fork
  * Fixes an issue in the `keymap_br_abnt2.h` file that includes the wrong source (`keymap_common.h` instead of `keymap.h`)
  * Updates the `keymap_swedish.h` file to be specific to swedish, and not just "nordic" in general. 
  * Any keymaps using this will need to remove `NO_*` and replace it with `SE_*`.
